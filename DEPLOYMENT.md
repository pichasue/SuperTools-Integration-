# SuperTools Website Cloning Process

## Overview
This document outlines the process undertaken to clone the "SuperTools" website, including the steps taken, decisions made, and challenges encountered.

## Steps Taken
1. **Initial Setup**: Created a local development environment using Next.js and configured necessary dependencies.
2. **Component Creation**: Developed the main components of the website, including the navigation bar, main content area, and footer.
3. **Styling**: Applied CSS styling to match the original "SuperTools" website's design, ensuring a responsive layout for various screen sizes.
4. **Image Handling**: Resolved issues related to image loading by replacing the `next/image` Image component with standard `img` tags due to runtime errors.
5. **Functionality Testing**: Tested all interactive components, such as the email subscription form and navigation links, to ensure proper functionality.
6. **GitHub Integration**: Initialized a git repository, committed changes, and pushed the local branch to the GitHub repository for deployment.

## Challenges Encountered
- **Image Component Error**: Encountered an "Unhandled Runtime Error" related to the `next/image` Image component, which was resolved by using standard `img` tags.
- **CSS Styling**: Ensuring that the CSS styling matched the original website's design while also being responsive required meticulous attention to detail.
- **Deployment**: The initial plan to use Netlify for deployment was changed to GitHub Pages due to the Netlify account being flagged.

## Deployment
The website is ready for deployment using GitHub Pages. The process will be completed once GitHub Pages is enabled for the `pichasue/SuperTools-Integration-` repository.

## Future Considerations
- **Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions Pages**: These pages resulted in 404 errors during testing and will need to be created or linked correctly.
- **Form Handling**: The email subscription form currently accepts input but does not perform any action. Backend integration or JavaScript handling will be required for full functionality.

## Conclusion
The cloning process has been a valuable exercise in replicating a website's design and functionality. The documentation of this process will serve as a reference for future updates and maintenance.
